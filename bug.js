This error occurs when you are trying to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when you're using functional components and have asynchronous operations within useEffect hooks that modify state.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text>  {/* Error here if data is null */}
    </View>
  );
}
```

The problem is that `data` might be `null` initially before the fetch request completes, causing a runtime error.  The `data.name` access attempts to use the property before the value is available.
